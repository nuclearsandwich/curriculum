  Hopefully you just had an awesome time, your eyes are open to the awesome new
  realm of what can be accomplished with a bit of effort and a good attitude.
  But what do you do now that the workshop day is over? The end of  workshop
  isn't the end of your programming career, it's the start.

  continue at all. There's tons to explore in greater detail than we have time
  to get to in a single day. Find something that interests you and dive into it!
